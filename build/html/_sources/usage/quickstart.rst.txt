Quick start 
=============
I have been writing Seispy when I was a master student. At first, I wanted to calculate Receiver Functions in Python, but there is no suitable toolkit. Fortunately, The obspy provided mounts of APIs for processing seismic data, so I ported codes for calculating Receiver Functions from Matlab to Python. Today increased functions have been added to Seispy to further process seismic data over than Obspy.
